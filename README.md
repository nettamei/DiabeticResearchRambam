**Abstract**

Our project focuses on discovering frequent temporal patterns among hospitalized Type 2 diabetes patients, based on a comprehensive dataset collected at Rambam Medical Center over a span of 12 years. The goal was to compare the distribution of these patterns across four clinical outcome groups: hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia (glucose >180 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (glucose >200 mg/dL), and myocardial infarction.
The project involved several critical stages in the pipeline: selecting relevant clinical concepts (e.g., lab tests, medications, diagnoses), cleaning and organizing the data, running the Temporal Mediator to transform raw clinical events to temporal abstractions, and discover frequent patterns using the KarmaLego algorithm. Subsequently, we conducted a comparative analysis using several statistical tests to examine the distribution of patterns between the positive and negative  groups for each clinical target (to identify differences), as well as within each subgroup of a target group (to assess internal consistency).
These findings are intended to serve as a foundation for the future development of machine learning models for predicting medical complications and issuing early warnings, with the goal of improving patient treatment outcomes.
